# REEF Name Service

Hey Folks! REEF Name Service [RNS] is a platform where you can get free Readable Name for your long REEF wallet address. You can use this dApp to transfer funds without using long wallet address, just use something like 0xanukul.reef or bandar.reef and that is it. Send funds to this RNS.

Planning to add more functionalities like 
- linking RNS with DNS
- having multiple RNS for single wallet address
- locking a RNS for any fixed period of time
- renting RNS

You can see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdWmdGZfXw4) how to set up your Reef account.

Make sure to use the Reef Extension else you will get some ugly errors in dev mode.
